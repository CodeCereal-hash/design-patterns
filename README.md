## Hi, Welcome to This Repository!

Here, you will find **theoretical and practical examples** of various **design patterns**.

---

### Why Design Patterns?

Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. They provide a **standardized way** of solving issues, which can help in:

- Improving **code readability** and **maintainability**.
- Promoting **best practices** in software development.
- Ensuring **scalability** and **extensibility** of applications.

---

### How Is It Helpful?

- **Faster Development**: By following established patterns, developers can avoid reinventing the wheel.
- **Collaboration**: Team members can easily understand the code structure, as design patterns are widely recognized and documented.
- **Problem Solving**: They offer guidance for tackling complex design challenges.
- **Efficiency**: Reusable patterns reduce the time and effort needed to solve similar issues in future projects.

### Classification of Design Patterns

Design patterns are broadly classified into three categories:

1. **Creational Design Patterns**  
   Focus on ways to create objects while hiding the creation logic. Examples include:
    - Singleton
    - Factory Method
    - Abstract Factory
    - Builder
    - Prototype

2. **Behavioral Design Patterns**  
   Deal with object interaction and communication. Examples include:
    - Observer
    - Strategy
    - Command
    - Iterator
    - State

3. **Structural Design Patterns**  
   Focus on object composition and the relationships between entities. Examples include:
    - Adapter
    - Bridge
    - Composite
    - Decorator
    - Facade
